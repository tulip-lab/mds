Mary's activities represent a sequence of **`hidden states`**, while her observed behavior represents a sequence of **`emissions`**. Because you don't talk much and you believe she may lie to you, all you can do is try to guess her true state via observations taken over time. \n\nFirst you define the range of possible states **`M`**. You know Mary has a strong work ethic, both professionally and actively. So you conclude that when not with you, she could be at __`Work, Gym,`__ or __`Cheating`__. \n\nThese states are hidden to you and cannot be observed directly.\n\nYou do not know the initial probabilities **`pi`**, of which state she could be in. You decide that Work or the Gym is equiprobable, and that there is a small percent she is cheating.\n\n>**pi = [0.4, 0.4, 0.2]**",
