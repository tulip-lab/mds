An RDD is a distributed collection of elements. All work in Spark is expressed as either creating new RDDs, transforming existing RDDs, or calling actions on RDDs to compute a result. Spark automatically distributes the data contained in RDDs across your cluster and parallelizes the operations you perform on them.\n\nThe KDD Cup 1999 competition dataset is described in detail [here](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99).\n\n#### (1.1a) Getting the data files  \n\nIn this section we will use the reduced dataset (10 percent) provided for the KDD Cup 1999, containing nearly half million nework interactions.

In this notebook, we will first train a classification tree including every single predictor. Then we will use our results to perform model selection. Once we find out the most important ones (the main splits in the tree) we will build a minimal tree using just three of them (the first two levels of the tree in order to compare performance and accuracy.   \n\n\nIn this section we will train a *classification tree* that, as we did with *logistic regression*, will predict if a network interaction is either `normal` or `attack`.  \n\nTraining a classification tree using [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-decision-tree.html) requires some parameters:  \n- Training data  \n- Num classes  \n- Categorical features info: a map from column to categorical variables arity. This is optional, although it should increase model accuracy. However it requires that we know the levels in our categorical variables in advance. second we need to parse our data to convert labels to integer values within the arity range.  \n- Impurity metric  \n- Tree maximum depth  \n- And tree maximum number of bins  \n\nWe will use a complete dataset provided for the [KDD Cup 1999](http://kdd.ics.uciW.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html), containing nearly half million nework interactions.

MLlib supports Pearson's chi-squared ( \u03c72) tests for goodness of fit and independence. The goodness of fit test requires an input type of `Vector`, whereas the independence test requires a `Matrix` as input. Moreover, MLlib also supports the input type `RDD[LabeledPoint]` to enable feature selection via chi-squared independence tests. Again, these methods are part of the [`Statistics`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.stat.Statistics) package.  ",

Internally, MLlib will calculate a contingency matrix and perform the Persons's chi-squared (\u03c72) test. Features need to be categorical. Real-valued features will be treated as categorical in each of its different values. There is a limit of 1000 different values, so we need either to leave out some features or categorise them. In this case, we will consider just features that either take boolean values or just a few different numeric values in our dataset. We could overcome this limitation by defining a more complex `parse_interaction` function that categorises each feature properly.       ",
