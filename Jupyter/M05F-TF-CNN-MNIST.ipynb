In our case, the target will be the digit (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) and the observations are the intensity and relative position of pixels. After some training, it's possible to generate a \"function\" that map inputs (digit image) to desired outputs(type of digit). The only problem is how well this map operation occurs.
