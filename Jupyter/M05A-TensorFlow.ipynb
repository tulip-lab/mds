Getting started with TensorFlow</span>\n\nTensorFlow is a powerful open source software library for numerical computation, particularly well-suited for large-scale Machine Learning and highly-optimized for Deep Learning. Its basic principle is simple: you first define in Python a graph of computations to perform, and then TensorFlow takes that graph and runs it efficiently using optimized C++ code.\n\nTensorFlow has many advanced features. The **coolest** are:\n* ***Programmer friendly***: The front-end high-level Python API of TensorFlow offers much more flexibility (at the cost of higher complexity) to efficiently create all sorts of computations, including any neural network architecture you can come up with. In addition, there are many higher-level packages that serve as TensorFlow's wrappers to provide even simpler APIs such as TF.Learn ([http://tflearn.org/](http://tflearn.org/), compatible with Scikit-Learn), Keras ([https://keras.io/](https://keras.io/)), to name a few. You can use these APIs to train various types of neural networks in just a few lines of code.\n* ***Machine learner friendly***: TensorFlow automatically takes care of computing the gradients of the functions you define. This is called automatic differentiating (or `autodiff`).\n* ***TensorBoard***: TensorFlow also comes with a great visualization tool called *TensorBoard* that allows you to browse through the computation graph, view learning curves, and more. This feature is extremely useful for researchers.\n* ***Highly-optimized back-end***: TensorFlow includes highly efficient C++ implementations of many machine learning operations, particularly those needed to build neural networks. There is also a C++ API to define your own high-performance operations. * TensorFlow can train a network with millions of parameters on a training set composed of billions of instances with millions of features each.\n* ***Device switchable***: You can switch between computation on CPU and GPU with one line of code: `tf.device('cpu')` or `tf.device('gpu:x')`.\n* ***Parallelized and Distributed***: It is possible to break up the graph into several chunks and run them in parallel across multiple CPUs or GPUs. Moreover, TensorFlow also supports distributed computing, so you can train colossal neural networks on humongous training sets in a reasonable amount of time by splitting the computations across hundreds of servers.\n* ***Cross-platform***: TensorFlow can run not only on Windows, Linux, and macOS, but also on mobile devices, including both iOS and Android.\n* Last but not least, TensorFlow was developed by **Google Brain** team, and have been being long-term supported and maintained by **Google**. It powers many of Google\u2019s large-scale services, such as Google Cloud Speech, Google Photos, and Google Search.",

How does TensorFlow work?\n\nTensorFlow's capability to execute the code on different devices such as CPUs and GPUs is a consequence of it's specific structure:\n\nTensorFlow defines computations as Graphs, and these are made with operations (also know as \u201cops\u201d). So, when we work with TensorFlow, it is the same as defining a series of operations in a Graph.\n\nTo execute these operations as computations, we must launch the Graph into a Session. The session translates and passes the operations represented into the graphs to the device you want to execute them on, be it a GPU or CPU.\n\nFor example, the image below represents a graph in TensorFlow. _W_, _x_ and b are tensors over the edges of this graph. _MatMul_ is an operation over the tensors _W_ and _x_, after that _Add_ is called and add the result of the previous operator with _b_. The resultant tensors of each operation cross the next one until the end where it's possible to get the wanted result.",

The information contained into an image is the intensity of each channel color into the width and height of the image, just like this:\n\n<img src='https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/xlpv9h5xws248c09k1rlx7cer69y4grh.png'>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">[[Image Source]](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn424131.aspx)</div>\n\nSo the intensity of the red channel at each point with width and height can be represented into a matrix, the same goes for the blue and green channels, so we end up having three matrices, and when these are combined they form a tensor. \n",
