    "TensorFlow is a powerful open source software library for numerical computation, particularly well-suited for large-scale Machine Learning and highly-optimized for Deep Learning. Its basic principle is simple: you first define in Python a graph of computations to perform, and then TensorFlow takes that graph and runs it efficiently using optimized C++ code.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow has many advanced features. The **coolest** are:\n",
    "* ***Programmer friendly***: The front-end high-level Python API of TensorFlow offers much more flexibility (at the cost of higher complexity) to efficiently create all sorts of computations, including any neural network architecture you can come up with. In addition, there are many higher-level packages that serve as TensorFlow's wrappers to provide even simpler APIs such as TF.Learn ([http://tflearn.org/](http://tflearn.org/), compatible with Scikit-Learn), Keras ([https://keras.io/](https://keras.io/)), to name a few. You can use these APIs to train various types of neural networks in just a few lines of code.\n",
    "* ***Machine learner friendly***: TensorFlow automatically takes care of computing the gradients of the functions you define. This is called automatic differentiating (or `autodiff`).\n",
    "* ***TensorBoard***: TensorFlow also comes with a great visualization tool called *TensorBoard* that allows you to browse through the computation graph, view learning curves, and more. This feature is extremely useful for researchers.\n",
    "* ***Highly-optimized back-end***: TensorFlow includes highly efficient C++ implementations of many machine learning operations, particularly those needed to build neural networks. There is also a C++ API to define your own high-performance operations. * TensorFlow can train a network with millions of parameters on a training set composed of billions of instances with millions of features each.\n",
    "* ***Device switchable***: You can switch between computation on CPU and GPU with one line of code: `tf.device('cpu')` or `tf.device('gpu:x')`.\n",
    "* ***Parallelized and Distributed***: It is possible to break up the graph into several chunks and run them in parallel across multiple CPUs or GPUs. Moreover, TensorFlow also supports distributed computing, so you can train colossal neural networks on humongous training sets in a reasonable amount of time by splitting the computations across hundreds of servers.\n",
    "* ***Cross-platform***: TensorFlow can run not only on Windows, Linux, and macOS, but also on mobile devices, including both iOS and Android.\n",
    "* Last but not least, TensorFlow was developed by **Google Brain** team, and have been being long-term supported and maintained by **Google**. It powers many of Google’s large-scale services, such as Google Cloud Speech, Google Photos, and Google Search."

    "\n",
    "The Tensor structure helps us by giving the freedom to shape the dataset the way we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it is particularly helpful when dealing with images, due to the nature of how information in images are encoded,\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about images, its easy to understand that it has a height and width, so it would make sense to represent the information contained in it with a two dimensional strucutre (a matrix)... until you remember that images have colors, and to add information about the colors, we need another dimension, and thats when Tensors become particulary helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images are encoded into color channels, the image data is represented into each color intensity in a color channel at a given point, the most common one being RGB, which means Red, Blue and Green. The information contained into an image is the intensity of each channel color into the width and height of the image, just like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "So the intensity of the red channel at each point with width and height can be represented into a matrix, the same goes for the blue and green channels, so we end up having three matrices, and when these are combined they form a tensor. \n"
