Introduction\n\nAn autoencoder, also known as autoassociator or Diabolo networks, is a artificial neural network employed to recreate the given input.\nIt takes a set of **unlabeled** inputs, encodes them and then tries to extract the most valuable information from them.\nThey are used for feature extraction, learning generative models of data, dimensionality reduction and can be used for compression. \n\nA 2006 paper named Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks, done by G. E. Hinton and R. R. Salakhutdinov, showed better results than years of refining other types of network, and was a breakthrough in the field of Neural Networks, a field that was \"stagnant\" for 10 years.\n\nNow, autoencoders, based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, are employed in some of the largest deep learning applications. They are the building blocks of Deep Belief Networks (DBN).\n\n<img src = \"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/xlkv9v7xzxhjww681dq3h1pydxcm4ktp.png\" style=\"width: 350px;\"/>",

Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction\n\nAn example given by Nikhil Buduma in KdNuggets (<a href=\"http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/03/deep-learning-curse-dimensionality-autoencoders.html\">link</a>) can explain the utility of this type of Neural Network with excellence.\n\nSay that you want to extract what feeling the person in a photography is feeling. Using as an example the following 256x256 grayscale picture:\n\n<img src = \"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/r5knpow4bk2farlvxia71e9jp2f2u126.png\" />\n\nBut then we start facing a bottleneck! This image being 256x256 correspond with an input vector of 65536 dimensions! If we used an image produced with convential cellphone cameras, that generates images of 4000 x 3000 pixels, we would have 12 million dimensions to analyse.\n\n\nThis bottleneck is further problematized as the difficulty of a machine learning problem is increased as more dimensions are involved. According to a 1982 study by C.J. Stone (<a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jizhu/jizhu/wuke/Stone-AoS82.pdf\">link</a>), the time to fit a model, at best, is:\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n<center><font size = 6><strong>$m^{-p/(2p+d)}$</strong></font></center>\n<br>\nWhere:\n<br>\nm: Number of data points\n<br>\nd: Dimensionality of the data\n<br>\np: Parameter that depends on the model\n</div>\n\nAs you can see, it increases exponentially!\nReturning to our example, we don't need to use all of the 65,536 dimensions to classify an emotion. A human identify emotions according to some specific facial expression, some **key features**, like the shape of the mouth and eyebrows.\n\n<img src=\"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/m8urvuqujkt2vt1ru1fnslzh24pv7hn4.png\" height=\"256\" width=\"256\"/>",

Autoencoder Structure\n\n<img src=\"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/no7omt2jhqvv7uuls7ihnzikyl9ysnfp.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n\nAn autoencoder can be divided in two parts, the **encoder** and the **decoder**.\n\nThe encoder needs to compress the representation of an input. In this case we are going to compress the face of our actor, that consists of 2000 dimensional data to only 30 dimensions, taking some steps between this compression.\n\nThe decoder is a reflection of the encoder network. It works to recreate the input, as closely as possible. It has an important role during training, to force the autoencoder to select the most important features in the compressed representation.\n",

Performance\n\nAfter the training has been done, you can use the encoded data as a reliable dimensionally-reduced data, applying it to any problems that a dimensionality reduction problem seem to fit.\n\n<img src=\"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/yt3xyon4g2jyw1w9qup1mvx7cgh28l64.png\"</img>\n\nThis image was extracted from the Hinton paper comparing the two-dimensional reduction for 500 digits of the MNIST, with PCA on the left and autoencoder on the right. We can see that the autoencoder provided us with a better separation of data.",
