    "## World differences in infectious tuberculosis prevalence\n",

    "> [From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis)  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Tuberculosis, MTB, or TB (short for tubercle bacillus), in the past also called phthisis, phthisis pulmonalis, or consumption, is a widespread, and in many cases fatal, infectious disease caused by various strains of mycobacteria, usually Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis typically attacks the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. It is spread through the air when people who have an active TB infection cough, sneeze, or otherwise transmit respiratory fluids through the air. Most infections do not have symptoms, known as latent tuberculosis. About one in ten latent infections eventually progresses to active disease which, if left untreated, kills more than 50% of those so infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first approach to the world situation regarding infectious tuberculosis we want to have a look at how different countries have been affected by the disease in the period from 1990 to 2007. By doing so we want to better understand different trends in the prevalence of this important disease. Which countries are getting better and worse? Are there more or less clear groups of countries based on how much are the affected and how their situation is changeing?\n",
    "\n",
    "This should be enough for a first approach that opens the door to future works in finding the reasons for this situation and how the different approaches to fight the disease have been doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Gapminder website](http://www.gapminder.org/) presents itself as *a fact-based worldview*. It is a comprehensive resource for data regarding different countries and territories indicators.

We can also cross link this datasets with others related to HIV/AIDS in order to confirm the co-ocurrence of both diseases.  \n",

    "This analysis also opens the door to analyise the impact of Tuberculosis programs. Once we are able to identify different groups of countries and their tendencies, we can follow them over time and associate changes (e.g. prevalence or incidence) with the time when these programs started.  \n",
