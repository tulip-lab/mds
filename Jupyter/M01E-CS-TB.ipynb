Tuberculosis typically attacks the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. It is spread through the air when people who have an active TB infection cough, sneeze, or otherwise transmit respiratory fluids through the air. Most infections do not have symptoms, known as latent tuberculosis. About one in ten latent infections eventually progresses to active disease which, if left untreated, kills more than 50% of those so infected.\n\nIn this first approach to the world situation regarding infectious tuberculosis we want to have a look at how different countries have been affected by the disease in the period from 1990 to 2007. By doing so we want to better understand different trends in the prevalence of this important disease. Which countries are getting better and worse? Are there more or less clear groups of countries based on how much are the affected and how their situation is changeing?\n\nThis should be enough for a first approach that opens the door to future works in finding the reasons for this situation and how the different approaches to fight the disease have been doing.  \n\nThe [Gapminder website](http://www.gapminder.org/) presents itself as *a fact-based worldview*. It is a comprehensive resource for data regarding different countries and territories indicators. For this article, we will use a dataset related to [estimated prevalence (existing cases) per 100K](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X5Jp7Q8pTs3KLJ5JBWKhncVACGsg5v4xu6badNs4C7I/pub?gid=0) coming from the World Health Organization (WHO).

You can google about ['high prevalence tuberculosis Djibouti'](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=high+prevalence+tuberculosis+djibouti) and see how this situation has been and still is subject to study and actions. Wikipedia also has an [article about health in Djibuti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_in_Djibouti).  \n\n> In Djibouti, malnutrition is severe and the incidence of tuberculosis is high. Malaria is endemic. There were 3,111 reported cases of tuberculosis in 2009. The city of Djibouti\u2019s publicly supplied water is suspect because the system is in disrepair.  \n\nOur dataset estimates existing cases of tuberculosis per 100K. We don't know if that number in Wikipedia makes reference to new or existing cases, but it seems to be by absolute terms and not per 100K. In both cases, new and existing, if we compare the WHO numbers for 2007, it seems a reduction in the number of cases (e.g. the number of estimated new cases in 2007 was 6,769). The population of the country is 810,179.     ",

In words of its authors, Bokeh's goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), but also deliver this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. \n\nThe first thing we need to do is import the *Bokeh* library as follows.",

There are other analysis we can carry out by using complementary datasets form the World Health Organisation, such as detection rates, new cases, or deaths. We can also cross link this datasets with others related to HIV/AIDS in order to confirm the co-ocurrence of both diseases.  \n\nThis analysis also opens the door to analyise the impact of Tuberculosis programs. Once we are able to identify different groups of countries and their tendencies, we can follow them over time and associate changes (e.g. prevalence or incidence) with the time when these programs started.  \n\nAll these approaches should create awareness on the real situation of a disease that is causing millions of deaths in some countries, while it was about to be neglected in some others.
