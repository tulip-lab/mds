            "source": "## Drawing Multiple Plots With `subplot`\n\nThe `subplot` function can be used to create a single plot in a grid of subplots. It takes three integer values: the first two describe the shape of the grid and the third is the index of the subplot you want to create. So, for example, if we wanted to create a pair of subplots, one beside the other horizontally, we would call the `subplot` function with the first number set to 1, to signify that our grid will have 1 row, and the second number set to 2, to signify that our grid will contain 2 columns. Our grid would then contain 2 sublots, numbered 1 and 2, since the `subplot` function assumes that subplots are indexed starting at 1.\n\nLet's try creating that horizontal grid of subplots now. \n\nThe very first thing we'll do is adjust the width of our figure slightly, otherwise, we'll end up with two very narrow subplots since the default width is only appropriate for a single plot. On line 2, you can see the code makes a call to the `pyplot.gcf` function to get the current `Figure` object, and then it calls the `Figure.set_figwidth` function to adjust the width of the figure. Next, on line 5, we'll call the `subplot` function to create the first plot in the grid. This call will create an instance of the `Axes` class and set it as the current axes object on the current figure. Then, we'll call the `scatter` function we created above, pass in our data, and specify the sepal length and width as the features we want to show in our first plot.\n\nTo plot the second scatterplot, you simply call the `subplot` function again with the same number of rows and columns, but this time with the index value of the next plot in the grid, that would be the number 2 in this case. Notice, in this call, however, that we are passing in the single value `122` rather than three separate integer values. This is a shorthand that the `subplot` function allows if you have a grid that has less than 10 subplots in it. Finally, on the last line, we call our `scatter` function again, this time with the petal dimensions and a different location for the legend so as to not obscure the data in the graph.",

The code below displays the same set of scatterplots, but this time, we'll display them in a single column instead of a single row. We'll also use the `subplots` function this time to create the entire grid of `Axes` objects ahead of time. \n\nThe important lines in this code are lines 5, 13, and 17. First, take a look at line 5. As I mentioned, this time around we're calling the `subplots` function instead of the singular `subplot` function. The difference is that `subplot` creates only a single `Axes` object when it's called, so you build up your grid one `Axes` object at a time. The `subplots` function, on the other hand, creates the entire grid of `Axes` objects at once and returns them, along with the current `Figure`, in a tuple. On line 5, we call the `subplots` function to create a 2 row by 1 column grid, and we capture the `Axes` objects returned in the variables `ax1` and `ax2`.\n\nOn lines 13 and 17, we see next bit of code that differs from the previous example. Since we're no longer creating each subplot as we need them, we'll need to set the current subplot, or axes, before we can draw each scatterplot. To do so, we have to call the set current axes function, `plt.sca`, and pass in the `Axes` object that we want to plot our data on. Once we've set the current axes, we can call our `scatter` function and it will draw the scatterplot using the `Axes` object we just set as the current axes.",

This subplot begins in very first cell, i.e., at the intersection of the first row and column, and it uses the `rowspan` parameter to specify that it spans across the first two rows in our grid. Line 6 does something similar, but it uses the `colspan` parameter to force its subplot to stretch across both columns in our grid instead. \n\nThe rest of the code below is, more or less, identical to what we saw in our last example and is here just to make it easier to understand what we're doing in the code above.",

It's just so easy to understand; you simply define the shape of your grid, pass in the row and column where you want your subplot to begin, and then specify its height and width by passing in the number of rows and columns that it will stretch across. Also, if you have any prior experience with creating tables in HTML, which many of you probably do, you're already intimately familiar with the row and column spanning specifics of this interface. \n\n",

You've seen how to create simple grids of subplots using the matplotlib's `subplot` function. You've also seen how to use the simple `subplot` function to put together a fairly complex visualization function called a scatterplot matrix. And, finally, you've seen how to use the `subplot2grid` function to create much more complex and interesting subplot layouts. With the tools you've learned over the past three lessons, you should be ready to tackle just about any subplotting challenge that your research can throw at you.",
