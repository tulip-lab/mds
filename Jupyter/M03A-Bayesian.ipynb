Imagine the following scenario:\n> A curious boy watches the number of cars that pass by his house every day. He diligently notes down the total count of cars that pass per day. Over the past week, his notebook contains the following counts: 12, 33, 20, 29, 20, 30, 18\n\nFrom a Bayesian's perspective, this data is generated by a random process. However, now that the data is observed, it is fixed and does not change. This random process has some model parameters that are fixed. However, the Bayesian uses probability distributions to represent his/her uncertainty in these parameters.\n\nBecause the boy is measuring counts (non-negative integers), it is common practice to use a Poisson distribution to model the data (eg. the random process). A Poisson distribution takes a single parameter $\\mu$ which describes both the mean and variance of the data. You can see 3 Poisson distributions below with different values of $\\mu$.\n\n$$p(x \\ | \\ \\mu) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu}\\mu^{x}} {x!} \\mbox{    for     } \nx = 0, 1, 2, \\cdots$$\n\n$$\\lambda = E(x) = Var(\\mu)$$",

If you see the trace snake up and down or appear to be stuck in any one location - it is a sign that you have convergence issues and the estimations from the MCMC sampler cannot be trusted.\n\n#### Autocorrelation plot\nThe second test you can perform is the autocorrelation test (see below plot). It is a measure of correlation between successive samples in the MCMC sampling chain. When samples have low correlation with each other, they are adding more \"information\" to the estimate of your parameter value than samples that are highly correlated.\n\nVisually, you are looking for an autocorrelation plot that tapers off to zero relatively quickly and then oscilates above and below zero correlation. If your autocorrelation plot does not taper off - it is generally a sign of poor mixing and you should revisit your model selection (eg. likelihood) and sampling methods (eg. Metropolis).",

Given two separate models, which is a better fit for the underlying data?\n\n----\n\n### Model Check I: Posterior predictive check\nOne method of checking model fit is called the posterior predictive check. I find this to be a very intuitive technique. You'll recall in the previous section we estimated the parameter $\\mu$ of a Poisson distribution by collecting 200,000 samples from the posterior distribution of $\\mu$. Each of these samples was considered to be a credible parameter value.\n\nThe posterior predictive check requires one to generate new data from the predicted model. What does that mean? Well, we have estimated 200,000 credible values of $\\mu$ for the Poisson distribution. That means we can construct 200,000 Poisson distributions with these values and then randomly sample from these distributions. This is formally represented as:\n\n$$p(\\tilde{y}|y) = \\int p(\\tilde{y}|\\theta) f(\\theta|y) d\\theta$$\n\nConceptually, if the model is a good fit for the underlying data - then the generated data should resemble the original observed data. PyMC provides a convenient way to sample from the fitted model. You may have noticed a new line in the above model specification: \n\n`y_pred = pm.Poisson('y_pred', mu=mu)`\n\nThis is almost identical to `y_est` except we do not specify the observed data. PyMC considers this to be a stochastic node (as opposed to an observed node) and as the MCMC sampler runs - it also samples data from `y_est`.\n\nWe then plot `y_pred` below and compare it to the observed data `y_est`",

This is an analytical method that aims to compare two models with each other.\n\nThe Bayes factor was typically a difficult metric to compute because it required integrating over the full joint probability distribution. In a low dimension space, integration is possible but once you begin to model in even modest dimensionality, integrating over the full joint posterior distribution becomes computationally costly and time-consuming.\n\nThere is an alternative and analogous technique for calculating the Bayes factor. It involves taking your two models for comparison and combining them into a hierarchical model with a model parameter index ($\\tau$). This index will switch between the two models throughout the MCMC process depending on which model it finds more credible.

In this linear regression, we could say for every unit increase in x, $\\hat{y}$ increases by $\\beta$. However, in the Poisson regression we need to consider the link function. The [following cross validated post](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/128926/how-to-interpret-parameter-estimates-in-poisson-glm-results) explains in great detail how we arrive at the below formulation.\n\n> For a Poisson model, given a unit change in $x$, the fitted $\\hat y$ changes by $\\hat y \\left( e^\\beta - 1 \\right)$\n\nThe main takeaway from this is that the effect of changing x depends on the current value of y. Unlike the simple linear regression, a unit change in x does not cause a consistent change in y.\n\n###  Marginal and pairwise density plots\n\nThe below plot shows the marginal densities (across the diagonal) and the pairwise densities (lower and upper panes).
