    "[Kruschke's book](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/) begins with a fun example of a politician visiting a chain of islands to canvas support - being callow, the politician uses a simple rule to determine which island to visit next. Each day, the politician chooses a neighboring island and compares the populations there with the population of the current island. If the neighboring island has a larger population, the politician goes over. If the neighboring island has a smaller population, then the politician visits with probability $p = p_\\text{neighbor} / p_\\text{current}$; otherwise the politician stays on the same island. After doing this for many days, the politician will end up spending time on each island proportional to the population of each island - in other words, estimating the distribution of island populations correctly. How a simple comparison of only two states at a time can lead to accurate estimation of a probability density is the topic of the next few lectures."

All code will be built from the ground up to illustrate what is involved in fitting an MCMC model, but only toy examples will be shown since the goal is conceptual understanding. More realistic computational examples will be shown in coming lectures using the `pymc3` and `pystan` packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian statistics, we want to estimate the posterior distribution, but this is often intractable due to the high-dimensional integral in the denominator (marginal likelihood). A few other ideas we have encountered that are also relevant here are Monte Carlo integration with independent samples and the use of proposal distributions (e.g. rejection and importance sampling). As we have seen from the Monte Carlo integration lectures, we can approximate the posterior $p(\\theta | X)$ if we can somehow draw many samples that come from the posterior distribution. With vanilla Monte Carlo integration, we need the samples to be independent draws from the posterior distribution, which is a problem if we do not actually know what the posterior distribution is (because we cannot integrate the marginal likelihood). \n",
    "\n",
    "With MCMC, we draw samples from a (simple) proposal distribution so that each draw depends only on the state of the previous draw (i.e. the samples form a Markov chain). Under certain conditions, the Markov chain will have a unique stationary distribution. In addition, not all samples are used - instead we set up acceptance criteria for each draw based on comparing successive states with respect to a target distribution that ensure that the stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of interest. The nice thing is that this target distribution only needs to be proportional to the posterior distribution, which means we don't need to evaluate the potentially intractable marginal likelihood, which is just a normalizing constant. We can find such a target distribution easily, since `posterior` $\\propto$ `likelihood` $\\times$ `prior`. After some time, the Markov chain of accepted draws will converge to the stationary distribution, and we can use those samples as (correlated) draws from the posterior distribution, and find functions of the posterior distribution in the same way as for vanilla Monte Carlo integration. \n",

    "#### Why does Metropolis-Hastings work?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ideas - first that the samples generated by MCMC constitute a Markov chain, and that this Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution that is always reached if we generate a very large number of samples. The second idea is to show that this stationary distribution is exactly the posterior distribution that we are looking for. We will only give the intuition here as a refresher.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One: There is a unique stationary state\n",
    "\n",
    "Since possible transitions depend only on the current and the proposed values of $\\theta$, the successive values of $\\theta$ in a Metropolis-Hastings sample constitute a Markov chain. Recall that for a Markov chain with a transition matrix $T$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi = \\pi T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "means that $\\pi$ is a stationary distribution. If it is possible to go from any state to any other state, then the matrix is irreducible. If in addition, it is not possible to get stuck in an oscillation, then the matrix is also aperiodic or mixing. For finite state spaces, irreducibility and aperiodicity guarantee the existence of a unique stationary state. For continuous state space, we need an additional property of positive recurrence - starting from any state, the expected time to come back to the original state must be finite. If we have all 3 properties of irreducibility, aperiodicity and positive recurrence, then there is a unique stationary distribution. The term ergodic is a little confusing - most standard definitions take ergodicity to be equivalent to irreducibility, but often Bayesian texts take ergodicity to mean irreducibility, aperiodicity and positive recurrence, and we will follow the latter convention. For another intuitive perspective, the random walk Metropolis-Hasting algorithm is analogous to a diffusion process. Since all states are communicating (by design), eventually the system will settle into an equilibrium state. This is analogous to converging on the stationary state. \n",

    "Suppose we have data of the number of failures ($y_i$) for each of 10 pumps in a nuclear plant. We also have the times ($_i$) at which each pump was observed. We want to model the number of failures with a Poisson likelihood, where the expected number of failure $\\lambda_i$ differs for each pump. Since the time which we observed each pump is different, we need to scale each $\\lambda_i$ by its observed time $t_i$.\n",

    "One-arm bandit refers to slot machines in a casino. The multi-arm bandit problem is that you are faced with multiple slot machines, and they each have potentially different payoffs - perhaps there is one machine where you could potentially win a lot of money and others where you would lose money in the long run. You need to balance exploration (trying different machines)  against exploitation (sticking to the best machine found so far) in an optimal way to maximize your gains. Suppose you were looking for a mate among N candidates - how do you optimize your dating strategy as a good Bayesian? \n",
